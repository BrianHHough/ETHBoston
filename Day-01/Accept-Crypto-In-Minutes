# Accept Crypto in Minutes With Coinbase Commerce
### Bojan Joveski + Cindy Kuang 


## Commerce
Commerce allows merchants to easily accept crypto payments with email.
By making an account on a website, in minutes you can make payments and withdraw to any address you choose.

## Code Highlights
Developers can leverage the Coinbase Commerce API to:
- Generate and monitor blockchain addresses.
  - THis is useful if you need per-user or per-session interaction: addresses monitored for 7 days after creation.
  - Currencies enabled: ETH, USDC, BTC, LTC and BCH; BIP32/44 compatible.
  - One master wallet derives all addresses.
- If payment confirmed on the blockchain, can send a notification that particular thing happened.
- Send webhook notifications: useful if you want to trigger some business logic in response to some payment event.
  - Mempool detection; block confirmation; amounts in crypto and fiat; etc.
- Integrate out of the box UX elements: useful if you need to quickly get your project's frontend off the ground:
  - automated email notifications.
  - Redirect URL on successful/failed payment.
  - Web3 (AKA Metamask) integration.
  - Etc.

## Examples
-  Permalinked hosted pages: "Help save the Earth: Donating to the Environmental Defense Fund....BTC, ETH, BCH, etc."
- Embeddable widget: 
- QR code generation: mobile wallets or real life interactions
