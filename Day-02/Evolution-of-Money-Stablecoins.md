# The Evolution of Money: An Introduction to Stablecoins
### Stable Coins + Enablement of Money with MakerDAO

## Timeline
Barter system --> cowry shells --> minted coins --> Gold Standard --> Fiat / Money --> Digital Money --> Cryptocurrency

Money = Fiat Currency: fiat is money without physical value

## Stablecoin = Cryptocurrency
- price-stabilized (Ex: 1 DAI = 1 USD)
- used as money
- you can trust it to have the same value tomororw, next week, next year, etc.
- it's a decentralized stablecoin-it's collateral backed (collatoralized debt position - take a loan out with DAI / you loan it out)
- Tether/USDC: claimed to be pegged to an actual dollar; massive reserve of dollars but don't know that it's true

## Historical Contest:
- currencies pegged to stable asset are not a new concept (many of the currencies of today were tied to gold for years and years)
- much like gold, we've seen currencies pegged to other stroger currencies

## US inflation: 2% per year
- Argentina Inflation: ~50% per year
- How do you protect your money?
- What if the banks decided you do not own your money

## Using Stablecoins
- you can buy real valuable things with it (it's not just a speculative asset)
- but you do need a specific offramp to take your cryptocurrencies and convert it to DAI and convert it to whatever currency you need.

## MakerDAO: Introduction to the DAI Stablecoin System
- DAI stablecoin system: 1 USD = 1 Dai

## What's the Point of DAI?
- a reliable stablecoin can be used for anything that you can currently use money for: everyday payments (don't want to be trading a speculative asset), held as savings (holding and can earn interest like a savings account), gifts, efficiency improvement for existing businsses; financial services for poeple who don't have access to a bank
- building a platform for others to build with (javascript library)
- making it easy for others to leverage and build on top of our system yourself. we do this by offering: Free and open access to our software; development kits; developer guides to get started and integrate with your business; grants for projects

## Why a Stablecoin?
- stablecoin is needed for mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies
- businesses and individuals require a stable way to transact with each other
- existing cryptocurrencies are too unpredictable
