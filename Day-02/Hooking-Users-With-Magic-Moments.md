# Hooking Users with Magic Moments

## IdeoLab
- human centered design
- we've been working and investing in crypto since 2015

## How do you get people excited about apps built on Ethereum/blockchain
- "human-centered design"
- IDEO: pioneered the field of human centered design: feasibilty, desirability, viability
- IDEO starts with the user (desirable) -- human centered design starts with people: who am I solving for, what am I solving for?

"how do i get users to that magic (a-ha) moment as quickly as humanly possible?"

Facebook: 7 friends in 10 days (this is the magic moment) = the reason for being there; 
- at some point there is that a-ha moment of getting there

## KPIs: 
- Facebook: connect with 7 friends in first 10 days
- Dropbox: save 1 file in folder on 1 device
- Twitter: follow 30 users
- Slack: 2k messages sent within a team
- Red Dog: Returing 1 day after sign up
- LinkedIn: x connections in y days

DeFi: look at deposits, assets (not really daily active users)

## What are the magic moments in crypto?
- giving people a dollar in bitcoin: the ability to send a fast and free transaction isn't that exciting (there's PayPal and Venmo) -- I'm going to recommend 3 wallets, choose one, install on phone, i'm going to choose a different wallet and I'll send you moment from a different wallet....oh wait you have a different free app than me and they can interoperate.
- Argent (Ethereum wallet) - smart contract wallet and you can put contract on chain daily-spending limits, can be overridden...but there's a time where you canreverse something....the safety it adds, get you there
- deposit interest on DAI: you are instantly using interest..earned all time...live earning....emojis with money symbol...visualizing what happens

With Burner Wallet, you have a QR code and that brings you to the magical experience of having an application with money in it.

## Tools to make applications that get users to that magic moment:
- Universal Login
- Portis
- Matic
- abridged.io

## NEAR protocol
- nearprotocol.com/get-started
- web based ID
