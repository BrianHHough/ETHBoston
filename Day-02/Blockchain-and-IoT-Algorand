# Blockchain and IoT: Building on Algorand

- Pure proof of stake (PPOS blockchain)
- Permissionless
- Fast tranasaction throughput 

## Verifiable Random Function (VRFs)
- Cryptographic primative that maps inputs to verifiable pseudorandom outputs.
- VRFs were introdueced by Micali (founder of Algorand), Rabin, and VAdhan in '99
- open sourced; used in block proposal and committee selection; cryptographic lottery; self selected adn verifiable
- talkng about economic decentralizaton: vote on who gets rewards; consensus is decentralized

## Algorand Consensus Overview:
- one account is chosen to propose block
- committee chosen to soft vote on the proposal
- new committee chosen

algorand.foundation/token-dynamics
-all uers online and offline eligible to earn rewards

## TestNet
- devnet; 
- testnet (1 year)
- mainnet (2 months)

## Algorand APIs and command line tools
- algod process: protocol and read only Rest APIs

Swagger.json

## SDK Functionality: go; python; javascript
- stand alone functions; create accounts; create pneumonics; create transaction; sign transaction; airgrapped applications
- kmd wrapper; algod wrapper; networked applications

## VRasberry Pi: single board of computer; general purpose input/output pins; 
- 2 breadboards - set up circuitry
- Labels to connect in and out;
- Bradboard connected to RFID scanner
- Never had to solder 

User RFID to read hardware account; rewards; total rewards. Making request by python SDK
- Can also run a node through Rasberry Pi
- Take account; go to the algorand dispenser
